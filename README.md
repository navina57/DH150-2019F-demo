The HealthTap app allows users to ask health related questions online or via mobile devices. It also connects users to U.S. licensed physicians and offers the ability to book appointments with a doctors for consulation over various means such as in person, over chat or via video conference. the app is designed to help users feel more comfortable in looking up their symptoms and gaining a peace of mind without having to struggle with finding sources on the vast internet. 

# 1. Visibility of system status 
Always keep users informed about what is going on.
Provide appropriate feedback within reasonable time. 

Evaluation: 
The symptom assement provided in the app is one of the main features. It allows users to communicate with the system and stimulates an experience similar to one where individuals can speak to professionals about their symptoms. Here, the app is quick to process and respond appropriately to the information given to it. While the system processes the symptoms ad prepares more questions to ask, it clearly notifies the user to wait. It also clearly underlines how the response given is only an explanation for a symptom rather than a clear diagnosis. I find it very useful that the app is also able to connect users with specialists who can further aid the indivual. The rating for this would be a 1.

# 2. Match between system and the real world 
Speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. 
Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 

Evaluation:
The symptom assesment once again does a clear job of using simple terms and everyday language to communicate with the user. I believe that this tatic is beneficial and boosts the overall experinece of the app. By using small, informal phrases such as "I got it" or even something as basic as "ok..." tet app creates a sense of comfort and makes users feel as though they are actually communicating with another human rather than just a computer program. Another key detail is how the page for the system assesment is designed to look like a texting conversation. I believe that this was an ingenious addition that adds to the experience by allowing users to feel more at ease. For this I would give the app a 1 for being able to bring aspects of everyday life into the app and make users more inclined to use it.

# 3. User control and freedom 
Users often choose system functions by mistake.
Provide a clearly marked "out" to leave an unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. 
Support undo and redo. 

Evaluation:
Another feature of the HeathTap app is being able to chat with a real doctor rather than just assesing the symptoms through a computer program. This feature however costs money. The program allows for you to leave the tab before paying money in case the user changes their mind. It also notifies the user that they are about to leave the page by saying "Are you sure?" Overall the app is easy to exit and navigate. The back button is on the upper left hand corner and is consistent with many similar applications. The exit button is easy to locate and is not hidden or difficult to access. I would give the user control and freedom for this app a rating of 1.

# 4. Consistency and standards 
Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. 
Follow platform conventions. 

Evaluation:
Overall the app is consistent with the most other applications we use daily. The exit button or each tab is consistently located at the upper left hand corner of each page. Once pressed, the app allows the user to exit the page and sometimes even notifies the user that they are about to leave the page. One thing I would change within the app however is for the symptom assement tab. While typing in symptoms, the cancel button is where the enter button usually is placed. It is right next to the word and is colored in blue so in a hurry, it is habit to quickly press "cancel" rather than enter on my phone screen. While typing in multiple symtos, this feature becomes increasingly frustrating as you have to go back and scroll through a list of symptoms. I would change this to move the "cancel" button to the left hand side of the page and the enter button to the righthand side of the page. For this reason, I give the consistency and standards a rating of 2.

# 5. Error prevention 
Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. 

Evaluation:
While entering the birth year for the users profile, it was interesting to see how the app had a maximum and minimum age limit (max: 150 years, min: 0 years). However, I thought it may be more efficient to just remove all the other years listed as an option. For example, it was not necessary to have the year 1820 listed as an option. Rather it would have been more beneficial to only list the years that were within the minimum and maximum age limits. For this reason I would give the app a rating of 2 for the error prevention. While it does not subtract from the quality of the app it could definetly be improved upon.

# 6. Recognition rather than recall 
Make objects, actions, and options visible. 
User should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. 
Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 

Evaluation
While attempting to chose various tabs available on the app, the user is able to use real world experiences to recognize and navigate the app. For example, the logos for each tab represent the function they perform. "Talk to a Doctor" has an image of a doctor and "Assess my Symptoms" shows a magnifying glass infront of a heart. The home button is also similar to those in other apps and is an image of a home. These consistencies allow the user to recognize functions and are able to find their way around the app more quickly. For this I would give the app a rating of 1.

# 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use 
Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. 
Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 

Evaluation
The app essentially mirrors a text conversation between individuals. In this the two individuals present are the computer program and the user. While discussing the symptoms, the app does a very good job of allowing anyone to be able to point out their symptoms by using a computer generated image of the bosy. I find this extremely useful as even people who are unable to verbalize where exactly their sypmtoms stem from, have a means of describing how they are feeling. I would give this a rating of 1.

# 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design 
Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. 
Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 

Evaluation
The app itself has a very minimalistic design. There are not many excessive colors or loud buttons. Rather the app focuses on the dialouges between the user and the program and allows for easy to understand text boxes. The use of blues and white within the app give the user a feeling of serentity and allow them to feel calm while researching their symptoms. For this reason I would give the app a rating of 1.

# 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors 
Expressed in plain language (no codes)
Precisely indicate the problem
Constructively suggest a solution. 

Evaluation
While exiting the text book for the tab "Assess my symptoms" the app allows the user to re evaluate whether they would like to leave the page or not. This allows for the user to save their work in case they accidnetally pressed the exit button. One thing I would change for the app though is if a symptom is added by mistake, it is not possible to remove this symptom from your list of symptoms. Instead you must go through the entire process again to input the correct symptoms. Allow the users to edit their symptoms would allow for a more efficient and accurate assessment. For this reason I would give the app a rating of 2.

# 10. Help and documentation 
Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. 
Help  information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large. 

Evaluation

The help section is not easy to access within the app. While there is a search bar, it is only used for articles within the app rather than actually helping with navigating the app as a whole. It would be more convient to have a section that guides the user in how to navigate the app as a whole and how to change information if needed. I would give the help and documentation section a rating of 3.
